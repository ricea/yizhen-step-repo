- type Union
- dataclass (skip boilerplate init)
- Abstract Base Classes(can be inherited by subclasses, cannot be instantiated directly)
- Enum: Create a collection of name/value pairs.
- regex:[-] or [\-] vs r'-':
  single hyphen might unintentionally form a range (e.g., [a-z] matches letters from 'a' to 'z', not 'a', '-', and 'z'). Explicitly putting it in [] or escaping it removes this ambiguity.
